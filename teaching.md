#### Teaching

- <small>Teaching Assistant, **FTEC 5050 - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (3 credits)**, Graduate Course, HKUST(GZ), 2025 Fall</small>
<!-- This course covers the fundamentals of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and their applications in computer vision, image processing, natural language processing, and robotics. The topics include major learning paradigms (supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning), learning models (such as neural networks, Bayesian classification, clustering, kernels, feature extraction), and other problem solving techniques (such as heuristic search, constraint satisfaction solvers and knowledge-based systems) in AI. -->
- <small>Teaching Assistant, **UCMP 6050 - Project-driven Collaborative Design Thinking (2 credits)**, Graduate Course, HKUST(GZ), 2025 Spring</small>
<!-- This course aims to familiarize students with the principles of design thinking and promote the adoption of a human-centered approach to problem-solving. Students will gain the ability to identify users' pain points, define problems, and develop creative and innovative solutions. By engaging in interdisciplinary collaboration, students will have the opportunity to apply their problem-solving skills to real-world projects. This course is divided into three modules, with each module being taken during one regular term. May be graded PP. -->
