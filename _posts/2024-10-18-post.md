Today I became a Ph.D. Candidate formally after passing PQE oral presentation part, and I have passed PQE written exam part on 2024/06/26

I have to say, for a student who studied in software engineering before and have no background with real analysis and finance knowledge, it is really hard to learn these PQE written exam courses. During the first year, I complain about that it is not reasonable for me to learn this course which is useless for my future research.

However, at this moment, I feel that if I didn't learn these course before, I will never learn them, which are really interesting as a part-time hobby. 轻舟已过万重山.
